**Stock Analysis**

The "stock_analysis" VBA macro is designed to analyze stock data in multiple worksheets within a workbook. It calculates various metrics such as yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each stock ticker. Additionally, it identifies stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

**Code Explanation**

The code uses a loop to iterate through each worksheet in the workbook. Within each worksheet, it processes the stock data row by row to calculate the required metrics. The code initializes variables and sets up the column headers for the results. 

The results are displayed in the appropriate columns, with positive changes colored green, negative changes colored red, and zero changes without color.
After processing all stock data, the code identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume. It stores the ticker symbols and corresponding values in separate cells.
The loop moves on to the next worksheet and repeats the process until all worksheets have been analyzed.
